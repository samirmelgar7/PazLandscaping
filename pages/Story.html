        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
          This company was built on hard work, integrity, and love for family.
          Our uncle founded this business with one simple goal: to provide for his
          family through honest work and dedication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Day after day, year after year, he showed up—rain, heat, long hours—
          never cutting corners and never backing down from hard work.
          He was a strong man in every sense of the word.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even through life’s challenges, and until his very last days, he never
          stopped working, never stopped caring, and never stopped putting his
          family first.
        </p>

        <p>
          His work ethic, resilience, and pride in doing things the right way are
          the foundation of everything we do today.
        </p>

        <p class="story-emphasis">
          Every job we take on is done in his honor.

      <h2>Continuing the Legacy</h2>

      <p>
        When Diego Paz passed away, the responsibility of the company was left to his son, Alejandro Paz, and his mother.
        At just 20 years old, Alejandro stepped into a role he was never fully prepared for, with little experience but a deep sense of purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Faced with the weight of loss and responsibility, he made the decision to carry on what his father built.
        Not for profit alone, but to honor his father’s name, work ethic, and the sacrifices he made for his family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through long days, hard lessons, and determination, Alejandro committed himself to learning the trade and leading the business forward.
        Today, the company continues to grow with the same values it was founded on — family, integrity, and pride in honest work.
      </p>

      <p><strong>This business is more than a job — it is a promise kept.</strong></p>
