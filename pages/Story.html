        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
          This company was built on hard work, integrity, and love for family.
          Our uncle founded this business with one simple goal: to provide for his
          family through honest work and dedication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Day after day, year after year, he showed up—rain, heat, long hours—
          never cutting corners and never backing down from hard work.
        </p>

        <p>
          His work ethic, resilience, and pride in doing things the right way are
          the foundation of everything we do today.
        </p>

        <p class="story-emphasis">
          Every job we take on is done in his honor.

        <h2>Continuing the Legacy</h2>

        <p>
          When Diego Paz passed away, the responsibility of the company was left to his son, Alejandro Paz.
          At just 20 years old, Alejandro stepped into a role he was never prepared for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through long days, hard lessons, and determination, the company continues to grow
          with the same values it was founded on.
        </p>

        <p><strong>This business is more than a job — it is a promise kept.</strong></p>
