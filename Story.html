<h1> Our Story</h1>

<!--add an img of my uncle -->

<div class = "DiegoPaz">
<img src = "photo.png" class ="img"> This company was built on hard work, integrity, and love for family.

Our uncle founded this business with one simple goal: to provide for his family through honest work and dedication. Day after day, year after year, he showed up—rain, heat, long hours—never cutting corners and never backing down from hard work.

He was a strong man in every sense of the word. Even through lifes challenges, and until his very last days, he never stopped working, never stopped caring, and never stopped putting his family first. His work ethic, resilience, and pride in doing things the right way are the foundation of everything we do today.

After his passing, we made the decision to carry on what he started—not just as a business, but as a legacy. Today, this company is proudly family-owned and operated, run by the next generation with the same values he lived by: reliability, respect, and quality work.

Every job we take on is done in his honor
